In most cities, homicides involving male victims are less likely to be
solved compared to those involving female victims, with odds ratios
often below 1. However, many confidence intervals are wide and overlap
with 1, indicating significant uncertainty and lack of statistical
significance in these estimates. A few cities, such as Richmond, VA, and
Oakland, CA, show potentially significant disparities, suggesting that
male victims may receive less investigative attention.

# Problem 3

**load and clean data**

``` r

**effect model**

``` r
model1 = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + wtgain + mrace, data = birthweight)
model1
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = bwt ~ gaweeks + wtgain + mrace, data = birthweight)

- For Model 1, I aimed to understand the relationship between the baby’s
  birth weight and potential influential predictors (gestational age,
  mother’s weight gain during pregnancy and mother’s race). The
  gestational age is a direct indicator of development, weight gain
  during pregnancy reflects maternal health, and race can be associated
  with different health outcomes due to socio-economic factors.

- The plot shows residuals versus predicted values. The residuals are
  randomly scattered around zero, indicating no strong patterns or
  biases, which suggests the model fits the data reasonably well.
  However, there are some outliers that might need further
  investigation.

**model using length at birth and gestational age as predictors**

``` r
model2 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight)

**model using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
(including the three-way interaction) between these**

``` r

            bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight)

**Model comparison using cross validation**

``` r
cv_results = crossv_mc(birthweight, 100)

cv_results = cv_results %>%
  mutate(
    model1 = map(train, ~ lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + wtgain + mrace, data = .)),
    model2 = map(train, ~ lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .)),
    model3 = map(train, ~ lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + blength * babysex + babysex * bhead + bhead * blength * babysex, data = .))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    rmse1 = map2_dbl(model1, test, ~ rmse(.x, .y)),
    rmse2 = map2_dbl(model2, test, ~ rmse(.x, .y)),
    rmse3 = map2_dbl(model3, test, ~ rmse(.x, .y))

**Plot RMSE comparison**

``` r
cv_results %>%
  select(rmse1, rmse2, rmse3) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "model", values_to = "rmse") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(title = "Cross-Validated Prediction Error for Models",
       x = "Model",
       y = "RMSE")
```

![](p8105_hw6_sz3214_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

- Model 1 has the highest RMSE, indicating poorer predictive performance
  compared to the other models.
- Model 2 shows lower RMSE than Model 1, suggesting an improved fit.
- Model 3 has the lowest RMSE and the narrowest distribution, indicating
  that it provides the most accurate and consistent predictions.
